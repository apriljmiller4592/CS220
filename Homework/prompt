Background:
A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or,
etc., as well as other more complex chips. This project engages you in the construction of a
typical set of basic logic gates and focuses on the documentation and building the code. These
gates form the elementary building blocks from which more complex chips will be later
constructed, and which youâ€™ll have to come up with the solutions for on your own.
Objective:
Build some of the logic gates described in Chapter 1 (see list below), yielding a basic
chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive Nand gates and
the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them.
